		<p>Much of our work and planning will involve simulations. By simulating products, machines and complex systems we can keep more of our operation digital while delaying and possibly outsourcing fabrication. This will allow us to collaborate and iterate on designs at faster and more efficient pace while likely saving resources and money.</p>

		<p>Much of our work and planning will be enabled by our simulations. We will design our software and hardware systems to run our simulations.</p>
